# Heading
To write a paragraph, you simply need to write text! If you want your text to be on a separate line, you'll need to skip a line.

No other formatting is needed to write simple paragraphs.
You can add _emphasis_ to text by wrapping the text in underscores. You can also **bold** text by adding two asterisks on either side of the text you want to bold.
You can add *emphasis* to text by wrapping the text in single asterisks or underscores, and you can __bold__ text by adding two asterisks or underscores on either side of the bolded text.
You can write code inline by wrapping text in backticks. This helps distinguish code, like `let x = 10`, from other text. 
```javascript
function hello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

You can write ordered lists by writing your start number followed by a period (.). On many platforms, you can actually just repeat this number, and the interpreter will order it appropriately for you. Here's an example:
1. Markdown
1. Is
1. Amazing

You can also write unordered lists by starting each line with a dash (-) or asterisk (*), followed by a space.
